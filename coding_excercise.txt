Let us know if you have any questions! If you're good to go, please send us back your exercise at your convenience (please upload your response to a public git repository, such as Github).



For questions 1 and 2, please see the coding_excersise.py script.

For question 3:
I'm not sure I would want to change anything. If I had to pick something: changing how Python handles global variables would be convenient for the kind of scripts I tend to write. I tend to need global variables that I access in helper functions and it would be convenient if I had a way to declare a variable as global once and not have to re-declare it as global within each function.
